# UserFilter-API
Live user filter with async javascript and randomuser api <br>

I get the datas from api with using async javascript properties. <br> 
Or you can just simplify get result from json file or creating a js file on your project. <br>

[Open src fetch api in this project](https://randomuser.me/api)

If you want to limit your results you can add this to the api link: '?results=50' <br>
